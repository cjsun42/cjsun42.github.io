description: Some notes on my usage of embedments and references throughout the VPAF project.

Throughout this project, I have completely avoided using copyrighted images in respect to the original artists. However, I still wanted to have visual attributions for the projects and people I am referring to, so I chose to embed 1-2 social media posts and profiles per entry instead. For each post, I gave credit to the artist, the photography (if known), and the uploader (if different). I try to hyperlink any relevant materials as well, as to make my sources accessible and clear.

I have also embedded YouTube videos for a couple demonstrations and talks. I made sure to caption them with the uploader and artist, as to clarify that I am not their creator in any way. There are some GIFs from GIPHY and public domain images from Unsplash embedded as well, used for decoration purposes.

I understand that the practice of embedding without creator permission has come under scrutiny in recent years (e.g. Sinclar v. Ziff Davis, LLC), which is why I took extra precaution to credit as many parties involved in the creative process as possible.

I hope it is clear that I am embedding these materials for educational purposes, in the tradition of art criticism and academic research. I in no way claim any ownership over the embedded materials.

In the case that conflict does arise over copyright infringement, I hope to argue Fair Use. However, I will also always prioritize the desires of the original artist. Given complaint, I would immediately remove any problematic embedments in this project.
