Well, hello there~ I am Chloe, a current undergrad at Bryn Mawr College in PA, USA. I am  very interested in History of Art, East Asian Studies, and Museum Studies. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about public education, art access, and cultural preservation, especially in context of pan-asian folk arts, such as shadow puppetry, paper cutting, and calligraphy.
